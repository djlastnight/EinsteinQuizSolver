# Einstein Quiz Solver
C# app intended to solve the Einstein quiz.

The current repository contains two different approaches to solve the quiz:

- The first one is my own implementation of the task. [Requires No dependencies]
- The second one uses Microsoft Solver Foundation (MSF). [Requires installed Microsoft Solver Foundation].
I'm currently using Microsoft.Solver.Foundation.dll version ```3.0.2.10889```
